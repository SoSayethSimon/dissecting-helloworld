						Of course you might ask yourself, why this could even be remotely interesting. 
						Well, instead of just looking at the code, we will also take a look at the 
						bytecode. And as it turns out both languages produce a heck of a different 
						bytecode to produce the same result. So, before we get started i'm a little 
						bit curious: who, out of this room, has already taken a look at the Java 
						bytecode of HelloWorld? And who did the same for Kotlin? As expected, most 
						haven't seen both, so this session should include some interesting findings for you.

						First of all, most of you probably know the role of bytecode in the JVM, 
						so i will keep it short. It works as an intermediary between our high-level 
						code and the low-level instructions for the JVM. The easiest way to take
						a look at the bytecode level is to use javap on our generated class files. 
						A typical output would look like this. As you can see, i've been using 
						JDK 11 with major version 55 for my examples. The Kotlin examples on the 
						other hand are in major version 52, so a few differences are to be expected 
						right from the get go. For the sake of keeping this talk concise, i've done 
						a little cleanup and will show you only the relevant parts. This will look 
						a little bit something like this - here you can see some typical 
						instructions like aload_0 and ldc which are used for loading a local variable
						or putting a constant from the constant pool on the stack. Later on we wil take 
						a look at the verbose output to take a closer look at the constant pool, which 
						will look like this.

						Now starting with Java. I hope everybody here has already seen this. Otherwise 
						i would question why you are attending this conference. But before we switch 
						to the Bytecode, let's have a look at what we should expect to find in our class 
						files. First off we have a class declaration, which means we also got a default 
						constructor. Then there is the main function. It's static, so we would also 
						expect to find this flag in the Bytecode. Then there is a String literal and 
						the constant PrintStream System.out. So far so good.

						Considering how small our HelloWorld 
						application is, you might be surprised that there are already over 30 entries 
						in the constant pool. The entries i want to have a look at are number 1, 2, 
						3, 4, 6. Constant number 3 is our String instance containing the literal at 
						entry number 23: Hello Java! Entries number 2 and 4 are the System out 
						PrintStream and the method reference for our println method. So we already 
						found a good bunch of the elements we were searching for, just by taking a 
						look at the constant pool. But why take a look at entry 1 and 6? Well, 
						keep them in mind - entry 1 is is the method ref of Object.init, the method for
						initializing a raw object that was created before with the new keyword.

						Going further we can take a look at the disassembled code. For overview 
						purposes the output you see here is just the simplified output, not the 
						verbose one. As you might have suspected we got two blocks declared in 
						this class file: our main method and the generated default constructor. 
						This will get more relevant later on. As you can see our default constructor 
						calls our method ref of Object &lt;init&gt; to initialize our HelloWorld Object. 
						Our main method on the other hand simply loads our PrintStream from entry 
						number 2, followed by our String at entry number 3 and invokes our method
						ref of println. That's all there is to it. Interesting enough by itself, 
						but not outstandingly surprising.

						So why should we stop there? Doing the same in Kotlin is just as easy, so let's 
						get right into it. First things first, i have to mention that there are multiple 
						ways we could write Hello World in Kotlin. And every single variant generates
						different bytecode. Yeah... so i've decided to start with the most similar 
						example. The reason is very simple: we will condense the differences to the 
						inner workings of the languages and ignore most of the syntactic sugar. As you 
						can see this example also looks pretty similar to the Java code in it's raw form. 
						I've even used the same System PrintStream instead of the native Kotlin functions. 
						But there is one big difference: we don't see any class declaration. This works
						fine with Kotlin.

						So let's take a look at the list of things we expected from our Java example.
						A class declaration, a default constructor, a static main function, a string literal, 
						a PrintStream instance. Let's go and add the Object init method call to this list, as 
						we found it in our Bytecode even though it might not be as obvious.	Well, can anybody 
						guess, what parts of this list will be missing in Kotlin? For those of you who might 
						have gotten excited that Kotlin lives without the class declaration, i have bad news: 
						we will find one generated for us. But this	generated class does have some interesting 
						features: it leaves away both the default constructor and Object init method call. 
						Instead we will find a bunch of other stuff.

						But where exactly do we find our Bytecode this time around - in case we haven't defined 
						a class on our own, Kotlin will simply generate a class file with the kotlin filename 
						and the suffix 'Kt' as it's filename, so in this case HelloWorldKt. And the first thing 
						you might notice if you inspect this class file, is the enormous constant pool with over 
						50 entries. All for the sake of a HelloWorld application. But why? Well, we can find our 
						main culprit right at the bottom of our output. One giant RuntimeVisibleAnnotation - 
						the infamous Metadata Annotation. For those working with Kotlin, who already saw that 
						annotation? And who knows what it does? Keeping it short, it contains a bunch of additional 
						information for the Kotlin compiler. But a few of those informations are also interesting 
						for understanding the inner workings. The entries number 38 and 39 define the "kind" of 
						metadata contained in this annotation: in our case it's kind number 2 which translates to 
						file metadata. The other kinds would be class, synthetic class, multi-file class facade 
						and multi-file class part. Each kind is treated differently by the intrinsics as you might 
						expect and our file kind is one of the flags responsible for the automatic class generation.

						Further down in our disassembled code we find only one method this time around: exactly 
						the main function we defined ourselves. No default constructor, no object init. This 
						was probably the biggest surprise for me when i first took a look at this example. The 
						aload_0 instruction moved from the constructor to our main function, but our generated 
						class is actually unable to be initialized. Instead we get some additional Kotlin intrinsics, 
						such as the invocation of checkParameterIsNotNull for our args parameter. A short look at 
						the verbose output also reveals, that the NotNull annotation was added as a 
						RuntimeInvisibleParameterAnnotation.

						Shaking things up for a bit, let's also have a look at an alternative HelloWorld. 
						In this example our main function forgos the args parameter and uses the native 
						Kotlin println function. On Bytecode level these changes are reflected by the 
						creation of a proxy method, which simply invokes our own main method. You might 
						also notice, that in this case we don't have any NotNull annotation as the Kotlin 
						compiler notices the irrelevance for this case. The println function on the other 
						hand causes a small change in the general application flow as it loads a single 
						constant zero before the invocation of the PrintStream method. I haven't been able 
						to figure out the meaning of this zero yet, if you've got a clue let's have a chat
						afterwards.

						So all in all, what do we take away from all this. Well, the main point is - even 
						a simple HelloWorld is worth diving to find some of the internal magic. As you 
						might expect those examples are just the tip of the iceberg. Given more time i
						want to create a longer session with more in depth examples, but of course everybody 
						here is free to explore the same. This direct comparison and analysis on bytecode 
						level helped me a lot in understanding some of the core concepts of both languages. 
						And i hope you can say the same about these 15 minutes.
